## Overview Of Analysis
The purpose of the employee database was to determine the number of employees eligible for retirement and to see which ones were eligible for the mentorship program to train the new employees. 

## Results
The results show the job title with the highest amount of retiring employees is for Senior Engineer's with 25,916 employees. Followed by Senior staff at  24,926 employees retiring. The job title with the lowest retiring employees is the Manager title. Howevever, from the mentorship eligibility list it shows that there are over 1500 people eligible to provide mentorship. This table includes a mix of each title so there will be people to mentor new employees for each job title. 
## Summary 
The data concludes that there is in fact a silver tsunami approaching. The number of employees retiring far exceeds the amount that are eligible for the mentorship program. Also, some job titles are taking a much bigger hit than others, Further queries could look into the amount of mentors available for each job title. Also, there could be another query done to look at promotions for Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. This could possibly help the company do more transitioning within the company to see how to offset needing mentorship if they hire someone already familiar with the company work. Or look at the promotion time length to see how many people should be eligible for promotion within the company by the time the big retirement hits.
